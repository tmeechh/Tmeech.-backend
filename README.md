I created this project using JavaScript and Node.js, incorporating bcrypt for password hashing, body-parser for parsing request bodies, cors for handling cross-origin requests, dotenv for environment variable management, express for server framework, jsonwebtoken for authentication, mongoose for MongoDB interactions, multer for file uploads, stripe for payment processing, and validator for data validation. All data from the Tmeech food delivery app is stored in MongoDB.
